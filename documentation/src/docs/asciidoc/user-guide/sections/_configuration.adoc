== Configuration via XML

cache2k supports an XML configuration file. The configuration file can contain additional settings that should
not be "buried" inside the applications code.

=== Using the XML Configuration

The configuration file for the default cache manager is located at `/cache2k.xml` in the class path.
Here is an example:

[source,xml]
----
include::../../../../../../cache2k-config/src/test/resources/cache2k-example.xml[]
----

=== Combine Programmatic and XML Configuration

The XML configuration can provide a default setup and a specific setup for a named cache.
The specific setup from the XML configuration is applied after setup from the builder, thus
overwriting any defaults or settings via the builder from the program code.

When a cache is created via the builder it needs to have mandatory properties on
the programmatic level:

- Type for key and value
- Cache name
- Manager with classloader, if another manager or classloader should be used

It is recommended to do settings in the builder, that belong to the application code, for example:

`eternal(true)`:: if no expiry is needed, in case the values are immutable or never change
`eternal(false)`:: if entries need to expire, but no specific time is set on programmatic level
`permitNullValues(true)`:: if the application needs to store `nulls` in the cache
`storeByReference(true)`:: if the application relies on the fact that the objects are only
                           stored in the heap and not copied.

For example, the cache is created in the code with:

[source,Java]
----
    Cache<String, String> b =
      new Cache2kBuilder<String, String>(){}
        .name("various")
        .eternal(true)
        .permitNullValues(true)
        .build();
----

In the configuration file only the capacity is altered:

[source,xml]
----
  <cache>
    <name>various</name>
    <entryCapacity>10K</entryCapacity>
  </cache>
----

=== Reference Documentation

==== File Location

The configuration for the default cache manager (`CacheManager.getInstance()`) is expected in the class path at
`/cache2k.xml`. If a different class loader is used to create the cache manager, that is used to look up the configuration.
If multiple cache managers are used, each cache manager can have its own configuration, which is looked after at
`/cache2k-${managerName}.xml`.

==== Options

Some options control how the configuration is interpreted.

version:: Version which controls how the configuration is interpreted. Needed for possible
          future changes. Always `1.0` at the moment.
ignoreMissingCacheConfiguration:: If `true`, allows that there is no cache configuration present for
                     a created cache. All the configuration can be provided at programmatic level, also the
                     defaults from the configuration apply.
defaultManagerName:: Set another name for the default cache manager, default is `"default"`.
ignoreAnonymousCache:: If `true`, allows cache without name. If a cache has no name
                     a special configuration cannot be applied. The default is `false`,
                     enforcing that all caches are named on the programmatic level.
skipCheckOnStartup:: Do not check whether all cache configurations can be applied
                     properly at startup. Default is `false`.

==== Default Configuration

A default configuration may be provided in `defaults.cache` (see example above). The defaults will be used
for every cache created in the cache manager.

==== Templates

Multiple template configurations can be provided under `templates`. Templates have a name.
In the cache configuration, a template can be included via `include`. Multiple templates can be included
when separated with comma.

Templates can be used for other configuration sections as well.

==== Parameters

The values may contain the parameters in the the style `${scope.name}`. A parameter name starts with a scope.
Predefined scopes are:

env:: environment variable, e.g. `${env.HOME}` is the user home directory.
top:: references the configuration root, e.g. `${top.caches.flights.entryCapacity}` references the value of the
      `entryCapacity` of the cache named `flights`.
sys:: a Java system property, e.g. `${sys.java.home}` for the JDK installation directory.

The scope prefix can also reference a parent element name. If the scope prefix is empty an value at the same level
is referenced.

A configuration can contain user defined properties in the `properties.user` section.

==== Primitive Types

The configuration supports basic types.

.Supported Types in XML Configuration
[width="70",options="header"]
,===
type,example,description
boolean,`true`,Boolean value either true of false
int,`4711`,Integer value
long,`20_000MiB`,Long value with optional suffixes (see below)
String,`alice`,A string value
,===

For additional convenience the long type supports a unit suffix:

[width="70",options="header"]
,===
suffix,value
KiB, 1024
MiB, 1024^2
GiB, 1024^3
TiB, 1024^4
k, 1000
M, 1000^2
G, 1000^3
T, 1000^4
s, 1000
m, 1000*60
h, 1000*60*60
d, 1000*60*60*24
,===

A long value may also contain the character '_' for structuring. This character is ignored. Example: `12_000_000`.
The unit suffix is intended to make the configuration more readable. There is no enforcement that a unit actually
matches with the intended unit of the configuration value.

==== Sections

The cache configuration may contain additional sections. At the moment only the section `jcache` is available
which tweaks JCache semantics.

==== Customizations

Customizations, for example, loaders, expiry policy and listeners, may be configured. The simplest
method is to specify a class name of the customization that gets created when the cache is build (see also example above).

[source,XML]
----
  <loader>
    <byClassName>
      <className>org.example.MyLoader</className>
    </byClassName>
  </loader>
----

It is also possible to implement an own `CustomizationSupplier` which can take additional parameters for additional
configuration of the customization. In this case the `type` element is used to specify the supplier class.

[source,XML]
----
  <loader>
    <bean>
      <type>org.exmample.LoaderSupplier</type>
      <!-- Additional bean properties to set on the supplier follow. -->
      <parameters>
        <database>jdbc://....</database>
      </parameters>
    </bean>
  </loader>
----

=== Rationale and Internals

Since version 1.2 the XML configuration is included in the `cache2k-core` jar file.
In a Java SE environment the default SAX parser is used. In an Android environment the XML pull parser
is used. There are no additional dependencies to other libraries.

Most of the configuration processing is not limited to XML. The general structure of the configuration can
be represented in YAML or JSON as well. This is why we do not use any XML attributes. Readers for
other formats can implement the `ConfigurationTokenizer`.

The configuration code is mostly generic and uses reflection. In case new properties or configuration classes
are added, there is no need to update configuration code. This way the extra code for the XML configuration keeps
small. Eventually we will separate the configuration into another project so is can be used by other applications or
libraries with their configuration beans.

The structure adheres to a strict scheme of `container.type.property.type.properties [ .type.property ...]`.
This simplifies the processing and also leaves room for extensions.
