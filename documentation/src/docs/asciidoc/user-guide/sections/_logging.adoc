== Logging

The log output of cache2k is very sparse, however, some critical information could be send to the
log, so proper logging configuration is essential.

=== Supported Log Infrastructure

cache2k supports different logging facades and the JDK standard logging. The supported mechanisms
include:

 - SLF4J
 - JDK standard logging

The availability is evaluated in the above order and the first match is picked and used exclusively for
log output. E.g. if the slf4j-api is present, the log output will be directed to SLF4J. This scheme should have
the desired results, without the need of additional configuration of the used logging facade.

=== Wiring a Custom Log Target

In case none of the above logging infrastructure can be used the service provider interface
`org.cache2k.core.log.LogFactory` can be implemented and provided via the `ServiceLoader` mechanism.
