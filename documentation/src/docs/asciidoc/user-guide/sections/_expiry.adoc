[[expiry-and-refresh]]
== Expiry and Refresh

A cached value may expire after some specified time. When expired, the value is not
returned by the cache any more. The cache may be instructed to do an automatic
reload of an expired value, this is called _refresh ahead_.

Expiry does not mean that a cache entry is removed from the cache. The actual
removal and notification of event listeners from the cache may lag behind the time of expiry.

=== Parameter and Feature Overview

This section contains a brief overview of available features and configuration parameters.

==== Eternal

If the cached data does not need to be updated it is logically never expiring.
A simple example would be a cache that contains formatted time stamps `Cache<Date,String>`.
Generating or loading the value again, would always lead to the same result.
If that is the case, it is a good idea to set `eternal(true)`. Since no expiry
is the default this will not alter the cache semantics, however, setting eternal documents that
expiry is never needed. The cache will not initialize any timer data structures.

==== Expiry after write / time to live

Expiry after an entry is created or modified can be specified via the `expireAfterWrite` parameter.
This is also known as _time to live_. It is possible to specify different expiry values for
creation and modification with a custom `ExpiryPolicy`. More about `ExpiryPolicy` is explained
below.

*Lag time:* Expiry is lagging by default, meaning that the mapping disappears shortly after the
configured duration. If an entry needs to expire at an exact point in time, this can be achieved
with the `ExpiryPolicy` and the `sharpExpiry` parameter, see <<sharp-expiry,Sharp Expiry>>.
The parameter `timerLag` is available to configure the lag of timer event processing.

*Exceptions:* When an expiry duration is specified via `expireAfterWrite`, resilience features
are automatically active. See the <<resilience,Resilience and Exceptions>> chapter.

==== Expiry after access / time to idle

There is no `expireAfterAccess` parameter in cache2k as it can be found in other caches.
As an alternative, the <<idle-scan,Idle Scan>> feature can be used, which is typically faster and
more effective.

If needed, it is possible to realize exact TTI semantics by updating the expiry time with every cache
operation. This also allows variable expiry after access. However, this is consuming more resources
then idle scanning. See <<tti-example,Time To Idle Example>>.

[[idle-scan]]
==== Idle Scan - an Expiry After Access Alternative

_Expiry after access_ or _time to idle_ is a feature often found in
caches and means that the entry will be removed after a period of no activity.
Typically this is used to shrink or grow the cache size depending on the activity.

cache2k does not provide the _Expiry after access_ or _time to idle_ feature, because its
implementation would slow down cache access times dramatically.
The parameter `idleScanTime` can be used to achieve similar effects, without any extra overhead
for a cache access. This is achieved by coupling the feature with the eviction logic
and reusing tracking data for the eviction that we have anyways.

More information can be found in the JavaDoc of and in the
https://github.com/cache2k/cache2k/issues/39[Github issue #39]

If the application needs exact "Expiry After Access" semantics this can be achieved
by updating the expiry time on each access via `Cache.expireAt` or
`MutableCacheEntry.setExpiryTime`.

==== Variable Expiry

Each entry may have a different expiry time. This can be achieved by specifying an `ExpiryPolicy`.
The `ExpiryPolicy` calculates a point in time, when a value expires. The configuration parameter
`expireAfterWrite` is used as a maximum value.

==== Variable Expiry for Exceptions

If the loader yields an exception `ExpiryPolicy` is not called. Its possible
to set a variable expiry for exceptions via the `ResiliencePolicy`. See
the <<resilience,Resilience and Exceptions>> chapter.

[[sharp-expiry]]
==== Sharp Expiry

In default operation mode, the cache does not check the time when an entry is accessed.
An entry expires when the timer event is processed, which usually lags behind up
to a second.

In case there is a business requirement that data becomes invalid or needs refreshed at a defined point
in time the parameter `sharpExpiry` can be enabled. This will cause that the expiry happens exactly at
the point in time determined by the expiry policy. For more details see the JavaDoc or
`Cache2kBuilder.sharpExpiry` and `ExpiryPolicy`.

The actual removal of an expired entry from the cache and the notification of expiry listeners will
always lag behind the expiry time.

If _sharp expiry and refresh ahead_ is both enabled, the contract of refresh ahead is stricter.
The resulting semantics will be:

 - Entries will expire exactly at the specified time
 - A refresh starts at expiry time
 - `contains()` is `false`, if the entry is expired and not yet refreshed
 - A `get()` on the expired entry will stall until refreshed

Sharp expiry and normal, lagging expiry can be combined. For example, if the parameter `expiryAfterWrite` and an
`ExpiryPolicy` is specified and `sharpExpiry` is enabled. The sharp expiry will be used for the
time calculated by the `ExpiryPolicy`, but the duration in `expireAfterWrite` is used if this will be sooner.
If the expiry is result of a duration calculation via `expireAfterWrite` sharp expiry of the entry will not be
enabled.

==== Resetting the Expiry of a Cache Value

The expiry value can be reset with the method `Cache.expireAt(key, time)`. Some special values exist:

.`Cache.expireAt()` constants
[width="70",options="header"]
,===
constant,meaning
`Expiry.NOW`, The value expires immediately. An immediate load is triggered if refreshAhead is enabled.
`Expiry.REFRESH`, An immediate load is triggered if refreshAhead is enabled. If loading is not possible the value expires.
`Expiry.ETERNAL`, keep indefinitly or to a maximum of whats set with via `expireAfterWrite`
,===

It is possible to atomically examine a cached entry and update its expiry with the `EntryProcessor` and
`MutableCacheEntry.setExpiry()`.

==== Wall Clock and Clock Skew

For timing reference the Java `System.currentTimeMillis()` is used. As with any application that relies on
time, it is good practice that the system clock is synchronized with a time reference. When the system time
needs to be corrected, it should adapt slowly to the correct time and keep continuously ascending.

In case a clock skew happens regularly a premature or late cache expiry may cause troubles. It is possible
to do some countermeasures. If the time decreases, entries may expire more early. This can be detected and with the
`AdvancedCacheLoader` the previously loaded value can be reused. If there is a time skew forward, expiry can
be triggered programmatically with `expireAt()`.

=== Examples

==== Expiry after a constant time span

All values will expire after 5 minutes with a lag time of around a second.

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Key, Data> cache = new Cache2kBuilder<Key, Data>() {}
      .loader(k -> new Data())
      .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
      .build();
----

==== Expiry after an exact constant time span

If needed, it is also possible to expire without lag. Values will expire
exactly after 5 minutes:

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Key, Data> cache = new Cache2kBuilder<Key, Data>() {}
      .loader(k -> new Data())
      .sharpExpiry(true)
      .expiryPolicy((key, value, startTime, currentEntry)
        -> startTime + TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(5))
      .build();
----

Data older than 5 minutes will not be returned by the cache, however, the
actual removal or execution of expiry listeners will still lag.

==== Variable Expiry Based on Value

The maximum a value is allowed to be cached can be extracted from the cached
value, for example:

[source,java]
----
  class DataWithMaxAge {
    long getMaxAgeMillis() { return ... }
  }
----

To instruct the cache to use it, an expiry policy can be specified:

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Key, DataWithMaxAge> cache = new Cache2kBuilder<Key, DataWithMaxAge>() {}
      .loader(k -> ... )
      .expiryPolicy((key, value, startTime, currentEntry) -> startTime + value.getMaxAgeMillis())
      .build();
----

[[tti-example]]
==== Time To Idle Example

Semantics of time to idle can be replicated by setting the a new expiry value
upon every cache access.

[source,java]
----
    private Cache<K, V> cache;

    public void put(K key, V value) {
      cache.mutate(key, entry -> {
        entry.setValue(value);
        entry.setExpiryTime(entry.getStartTime() + expireAfterAccess);
      });
    }

    public V get(K key) {
      return cache.invoke(key, entry -> {
        entry.setExpiryTime(entry.getStartTime() + expireAfterAccess);
        return entry.getValue();
      });
    }
----
