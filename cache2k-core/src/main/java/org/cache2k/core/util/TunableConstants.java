/**
 * Base class of all classes that contain code constants. For each
 * cache2k implementation class constants a centralized within an inner class.
 * The rationale behind this is explained in the following.
 *
 * <p>Wisely chosen constants are sometimes buried within the code.
 * These are the so called "magic numbers". So let's give them a default
 * place.
 *
 * <p>There may be a need to change such a "constant". This provides a simple system
 * wide mechanism to change a parameter, aka "tune" it. So, this can be used for
 * performance optimizations. It may be also possible to provide a tuning
 * set that goes tunes towards execution time or towards space efficiency.
 *
 * <p>Testing: Some code has operations that happen very seldom, e.g. for
 * reorganizing. For testing purposes we can trigger these situations by
 * de-tuning.
 *
 * <p>If there is a constant need to change a constant, please open an issue.
 * Either it is better to change the tunable constant to a real parameter
 * or a assign it to another value which fits the general purpose better.
