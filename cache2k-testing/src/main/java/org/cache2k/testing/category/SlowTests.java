/**
 * Slow tests like stress tests that run for seconds. Timing dependent tests should go
 * to {@link TimingTests} or may go into the {@link SlowTests}, too, in case the test copes
 * with the fact that the CPU might get no processing time for an indefinite amount of time.
 * If this is the case a test should wait at least 8 seconds for a predicted event to happen.
 * Assertions that fail, because they are timing related should indicate in the text message
 * with "(may flap)".
