# cache2k 1.9.2.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. The final release will be **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy

- OSGi support with `cache2k-osgi-all` removed, see: https://github.com/cache2k/cache2k/issues/83

## Possible Breakages

Since this is a major release, some rarely used things in the API are 
changed without backwards compatibility. Most code is supposed to run
without breaking.
