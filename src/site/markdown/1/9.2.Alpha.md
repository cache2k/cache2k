# cache2k 1.9.2.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. The final release will be **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy

## Possible Breakages

Since this is a major release, some rarely used things in the API are 
changed without backwards compatibility. Most code is supposed to run
without breaking.

- `Cache.getStatistics` removed. Replaced by `CacheManagement.of(Cache).sampleStatistics()`.
- `Cache.clearAndClose` removed. Replaced by `CacheManagement.destroy`
 
## API Changes 

- Renamed `ExceptionInformation` to `LoadExceptionInfo`
- `org.cache2k.jmx`, API for JMX MXBeans removed
- New interfaces `CacheManagement`, `CacheControl` and `CacheInfo` in `org.cache2k.management`

## Fixes and Improvements

- `Cache.loadAll()` and `Cache.reloadAll()` complete with exception if a a loader
  exception happened. If more than one exception happened the one is propagated.
- Improved interface of `ExceptionPropagator` and `LoadExceptionInfo`,
  A `CacheEntry` may be cast to `LoadExceptionInfo` if an exception is present
