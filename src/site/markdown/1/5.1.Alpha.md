# cache2k 1.5.1.Alpha

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

## New and Noteworthy

- 

## Possible Breakages

- No separate executor for async listeners by default any more.
  Defaults to the excutor defined by `Cache2kBuilder.executor` which is
  the common `ForkJoinPool` by default in Java 8.
- No extra Thread for expiry and refreshing per cache any more.
  This may cause more lag

## API Changes 

- Deprecated `ExpiryTimeValues.NO_CACHE`
- Deprecated `Cache2kBuilder.prefetchExecutor`, introduced `Cache2kBuilder.refreshExecutor` (rename) 

## Fixes and Improvements

- Remove hash quality metric
- `MutableCacheEntry.reload()` does load the entry even if already cached
