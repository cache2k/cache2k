# cache2k 1.3.4.Beta

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

## New and Noteworthy

- Stabilizing new features

## Possible Breakages

## API Changes 

- deprecated `AbstractCacheEntry`
- Weigher result type is `int` not `long`, the weigher is new in 1.3/1.4, so this is not breaking
  code running on cache2k 1.2.x

## Fixes and Improvements

- More tests and fixes with `Weigher`
- `CacheEntry.toString` output does not call `toString` on the value and print hashCode instead 
- doc clarifications
- Code style improvements
