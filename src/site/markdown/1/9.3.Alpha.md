# cache2k 1.9.2.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. The final release will be **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy


## Possible Breakages

 
## API Changes 


## Fixes and Improvements

- Within alpha: Un deprecate `KeyValueSource`, that's simple and useful
- Drop `ExpiryTimeValues.NO_CACHE`. `ExpiryTimeValues.NOW` which has a value of 0 means
  no caching, and does not start a refresh. Introduced `ExpiryTimeValues.REFRESH` again, since
  logically everything between 0 (exclusive) and the current time, expires and starts
  a refresh, if refresh ahead is enabled.
- Cap suppression or caching of exceptions determined by `ResiliencePolicy` to the 
  `expireAfterWrite` duration, if specified
