# cache2k 1.9.3.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.

The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. The final release will be **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy

- Update to enhance compatibility of client code between version 1.6 with 2.0 of cache2k
 
## API Changes / Possible Breakages

- Within alpha: Un deprecate `KeyValueSource`, that's simple and useful
- Drop `ExpiryTimeValues.NO_CACHE`. `ExpiryTimeValues.NOW` which has a value of 0 means
  no caching, and does not start a refresh. Introduced `ExpiryTimeValues.REFRESH` again, since
  logically everything between 0 (exclusive) and the current time, expires and starts
  a refresh, if refresh ahead is enabled.
- Within alpha: Reverse hierarchy for new CacheLoaderException, which enhanced compatibility with code doing an instanceof

## Fixes and Improvements

- Cap suppression or caching of exceptions determined by `ResiliencePolicy` to the 
  `expireAfterWrite` duration, if specified
