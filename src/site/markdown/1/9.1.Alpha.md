# cache2k 1.9.1.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. In contrast to version _1.6.0.Final_, which is 
still Java 6 compatible, this and the next version require at least Java 8 to run. 

The final release is planed as version **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy

- cache2k-api and cache2k-core have been modularized

## Possible Breakages

- Dropped apache commons logging support. Commons logging seems to be not 
  maintained any more and lacks Jigsaw/module support.
- Requires Java 8 to run and Java 11 to compile
- Drop support for XML configuration on Android, removed XML pull dependency
  (The Android will be potentially unsupported in cache2k V2 at first)
- Moved JCache configuration classes in `org.cache.jcache` from `cache2k-api` to `cache2k-jcache`.
  If these are used, `cache2k-jcache` needs to be in compile scope.
