# cache2k 1.9.1.Alpha "North Atlantic"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The preview is in preparation for version 2 which will have some major breaking
changes to the previous releases. In contrast to version _1.6.0.Final_, which is 
still Java 6 compatible, this and the next version require at least Java 8 to run. 

The final release is planed as version **2.0.0.Final - "North Atlantic"**.

## New and Noteworthy

- Modularization: Full modularization support fully modularized

## Possible Breakages

- Requires at least Java 8 to run
- Incompatible change of `CustomizationSupplier` interface
- `org.cache2k.integration.ResiliencePolicy` removed. Replaced by: `org.cache2k.io.ResiliencePolicy`
- JMX support moved from `cache2k-core` to `cache2k-jmx` to minimize module dependencies
- XML configuration moved from `cache2k-core` to `cache2k-config` to minimize module dependencies
- Dropped apache commons logging support. Commons logging seems to be not 
  maintained any more and lacks Jigsaw/module support.
- Drop support for XML configuration on Android, removed XML pull dependency
  (The Android will be potentially unsupported in cache2k V2 at first)
- Moved JCache configuration classes in `org.cache.jcache` from `cache2k-api` to `cache2k-jcache`.
  If these are used, `cache2k-jcache` needs to be in compile scope.  
  
## API Changes 

- `org.cache2k.integration.CacheLoader` and everything in package `org.cache2k.integration` 
  is deprecated. Replacements are available in `org.cache2k.io`. This major change was done to
  change from abstract classes to interface. The new package was introduced for smoother transition
  to keep the previous classes and deprecated them.

## Fixes and Improvements

- All cache customizations (e.g. `CacheLoader`) implement `Customization`.
