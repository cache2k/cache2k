# cache2k 2.3.1.Alpha "Port Philip"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The final release is planed as *"Port Philip" - **2.4.0.Final***.

## Fixes and Improvements

- Improved hit counter accuracy for statistics, see: https://github.com/cache2k/cache2k/issues/150
- Improved statistics retrieval. When requesting the statistics, e.g. for micrometer export, no
  expensive operations are performed any more and no cache wide locking is done. In consequence 
  statistics can be retrieved more frequently without big effect on the running application.
  Since there is no cache wide lock, statistics counters can have inconsistencies, e.g. the 
  inserted and removed entries might not match exactly with the current size.
- Eviction throughput improvement. The Clock-Pro ghost/history table is limited to 3K entries.
  Profiling showed that the big ghost table attributed to lower performance with bigger cache
  sizes (1 million entries) and did not contribute significantly to a better hitrate.
- Various code quality improvements
