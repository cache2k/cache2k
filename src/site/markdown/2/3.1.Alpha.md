# cache2k 2.3.1.Alpha "Port Philip"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The final release is planed as *"Port Philip" - **2.4.0.Final***.

## Fixes and Improvements

- Improved hit counter for statistics, see: https://github.com/cache2k/cache2k/issues/150
- Eviction throughput improvement. The Clock-Pro ghost/history table is limited to 3K entries.
  Profiling showed that the big ghost table attributed to lower performance with bigger cache
  sizes (1 million entries) and did not contribute significantly to a better hitrate.
