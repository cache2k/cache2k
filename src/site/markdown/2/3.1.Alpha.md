# cache2k 2.3.1.Alpha "Port Philip"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The final release is planed as *"Port Philip" - **2.4.0.Final***.

## Possible breakages

- `Cache.computeIfAbsent`: aligned to map contract. Semantics changed
  in case null values are permitted. A null value is treated as absent.  

## Fixes and Improvements

- `Cache.computeIfAbsent`: aligned to map contract
- `Cache.entries`: throws `IlliegalStateException` if `remove` is called twice on the iterator.
- `Cache.asMap`: aligned to the map contract, `equals`, `hashCode` cooperate with arbitrary maps,
   `toString` is implemented identical to Java maps (e.g. HashMap).
