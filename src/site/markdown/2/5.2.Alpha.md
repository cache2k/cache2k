# cache2k 2.5.2.Alpha "Cogee Beach"

This is a preview release for evaluation purposes and should not be used in production.
The final release is planed as *"Cogee Beach" - **2.6.0.Final***.

## Fixes and Improvements

- Documentation improvements
- `eternal(true/false)` / `MutableEntry.setExpiryTime`: Expiry can be modified, although 
  no other expiry setting is present, or in other words: the timer support is available by
  default. If `eternal(true)` is configured, timer support is disabled and
  `Cache.invoke` / `MutableEntry.setExpiryTime` cannot be used 
- `Cache.invoke` / `MutableEntry.setExpiryTime`: has no effect if entry is not existing 
- `Cache.invoke` / `MutableEntry.getExpiryTime` always returns positive time value
- Started with tests based on JUnit 5
- Documentation and examples for expiry, expiry policy
- CI tests with Android API level 26 and API level 30
- Expiry: handle time values close to `Long.MAX_VALUE` without overflow, although the application
  should not produce these.
