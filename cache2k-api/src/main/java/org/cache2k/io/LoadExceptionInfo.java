/**
 * Relevant information of a load attempt that generated an exception.
 * This is used by the exception propagator and the resilience policy.
 *
 *
 * <p>Compatibility: This interface is not intended for implementation
 * or extension by a client and may get additional methods in a new minor release.
 *
 * <p>Rationale: The information does not contain the time of the original
 * expiry of the cache value. This is intentional. There is no information
 * field to record the time of expiry past the expiry itself. The expiry time
 * information is reset as soon as the expiry time is reached. To produce no
 * overhead, the information provided by this interface is captured only
 * in case an exception happens.
