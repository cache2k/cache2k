/**
 * Retrieves or generates a value to load into the cache. Using a loader to automatically
 * populate the cache is called read through caching. If the cache is primarily used the
 * cache data that is expensive to generate or retrieve, using a {@code CacheLoader} has
 * several advantages. The usable features with a loader are explained in the following.
 *
 * <p><b>Transparent operation</b>: If configured, the loader is invoked implicitly, in case
 * there is no value in the cache, or it is expired, by the cache methods {@code get()},
 * {@code getAll()} or {@code getEntry()} as well as {@link MutableCacheEntry#getValue()}.
 *
 * <p>The cache loader can be invoked explicitly via {@link Cache#reloadAll(Iterable)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Blocking</b>: If the loader is invoked by {@link Cache#get} or other methods that allow
 * transparent access (see above) concurrent requests on the same key will block until the loading
 * is completed. For expired values blocking can be avoided by enabling
 * {@link Cache2kBuilder#refreshAhead}. There is no guarantee that the loader is invoked only for
 * one key at a time. For example, after {@link Cache#clear()} is called load operations for one
 * key may overlap.
 *
 * <p><b>Refresh ahead</b>: By enabling {@link Cache2kBuilder#refreshAhead} the cache will
 * call the loader when an entry is expired, eagerly trying to keep the cache contents fresh.
 *
 * <p>The alternative loader interface {@link AdvancedCacheLoader} provides the loader
 * with the current cache value.
 *
 * <p>The {@link AsyncCacheLoader} interface can be used to provide a non-blocking asynchronous
 * loader implementation.
 *
 * <p>If no loader is enabled, the methods {@link Cache#get} and {@link Cache#peek}
 * have identical behavior.

   * <p>API rationale: This method declares an exception to allow any unhandled

   * needs to deal with loader exceptions any way, this saves otherwise
   * necessary try/catch clauses in the loader and also reduces boilerplate code.

   * @return value to be associated with the key. If the cache does not permit {@code null}
   *         values a {@link NullPointerException} is thrown, but the expiry policy is
   *         called before it.
   * @throws Exception Unhandled exception from the loader. Exceptions are suppressed or
   *                   wrapped and rethrown via a {@link CacheLoaderException}. Rethrow
