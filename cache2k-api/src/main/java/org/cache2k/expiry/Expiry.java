  /**
   * Combine a refresh time span and an expiry at a specified point in time.
   *
   * <p>If the expiry time is far ahead of time the refresh time span takes
   * precedence. If the point in time is near, this time takes precedence.
   * If the refresh time is too close to the requested point an earlier refresh
   * time is used to keep maximum distance to the requested point in time, which is
   * {@code abs(pointInTime) - refreshAfter}
   *
   * <p>Rationale: Usually the expiry is allowed to lag behind. This is okay
   * when a normal expiry interval is used. If sharp expiry is requested an
   * old value may not be visible at and after the expiry time. Refresh ahead
   * implies lagging expiry, since the refresh is triggered when the value would
   * usually expire. The two concepts can be combined in the expiry policy, e.g.
   * using an interval for triggering refresh ahead and requesting a sharp expiry
   * only when needed. If effective expiry time for the lagging variant and the
   * for the sharp variant are in proximity, conflicts need to be resolved.
   *
   * @param loadTime time when the load was started
   * @param refreshAfter time span in milliseconds when the next refresh should happen
   * @param pointInTime time in milliseconds since epoch for the next expiry. Can be negative
   *             if sharp expiry is requested, or {@link #ETERNAL} if no point in time
   *             expiry is needed.
